# Contributing to Improving participation and collaboration on Mozilla Clubs Discourse

Hello and welcome!
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project to improve participation and collaboration on Mozilla Clubs Discourse. :tada:! 

Members participate on the Mozilla Club discourse channel to share updates, get information and to stay connected with the larger community. The aim of this project is to improve collaboration between the members and increase overall participation on the Mozilla Discourse channel. We're doing this by- 
- Assessing activity levels in current channels used for communication like- Facebook group, Discourse, Telegram group, Whatsapp group etc. 
- Interviewing community members on what inspires them to be active in these discussion channels and their motivations to participate.
- Gathering feedback on the incentives needed to improve participation

The feedback from the above activity would be conveyed to the community managers to incorporate any changes in strategy.
